LG, the world’s top air conditioning maker, said it planned to focus on emerging markets as weak economies and housing markets in Europe and the United States were likely to sap demand there.

SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST — Hong Kong’s Chief Executive Donald Tsang said in a commercial radio interview on Tuesday that his government will not lower the tax rate on corporate profits, despite a double-digit rise in tax revenue last year. — A residential and commercial site in Tseung Kwan O, New Territories, is open for bidding until Jan. 6, and surveyors estimate it will sell for up to HK\\$1.85 billion (\\$238.15 million) in the tender. The site can yield 488,180 square feet of gross floor space. HONG KONG ECONOMIC TIMES — New World Development Co Ltd Chairman Cheng Yu-tung raised his stake in Silver Base Group Holdings , an operator of alcoholic beverages in the mainland, on Dec. 29, buying an additional 1.62 million shares for about HK\\$10.175 million, according to an exchange disclosure. THE STANDARD — Internationalising the yuan is like raising a child, and Hong Kong is its nursery, the chief executive of the city’s stock exchange Charles Li said on his blog. The local bourse will be proactive in promoting the development of yuan interest rate, exchange rate and derivative products, he added. — Dalian-based developer Kai Shi China Holdings, which aims to raise up to HK\\$180 million by selling 150 million shares on the local bourse, said it plans to use 80 percent of the proceeds from its initial public offering to replenish the firm’s land bank this year. ORIENTAL DAILY — Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd Chairman Li Ka-shing bought an additional 330,000 shares of the company at an average of HK\\$92.423 each for about HK30.5 million on Dec. 29, the company said in a disclosure to the stock exchange.

    "- **LAS VEGAS (Reuters) -** A couple wanted for a crime spree through Utah and Nevada that saw an elderly pair slain in their home and a woman shot in the head was arrested on Tuesday wandering in the desert, authorities said. Logan McFarland is seen in police booking photos provided by the Sanpete County Sheriffs department in Manti, Utah, January 3, 2012. A couple wanted for a crime spree through Utah and Nevada that saw an elderly pair slain in their home and a woman shot in the head was arrested on Tuesday wandering in the desert, authorities said. McFarland, 24, and Angela Marie Hill, 25, were spotted by the pilot of a sheriff's plane in a remote area of Elko County, in northern Nevada, Supervisory Deputy U.S. Marshal Jim Phelps told Reuters. REUTERS/U.S. Marshals Service/HandoutSuspects Logan McFarland, 24, and Angela Marie Hill, 25, were spotted by the pilot of a sheriff’s plane in a remote area of Elko County in northern Nevada, Supervisory Deputy U.S. Marshal Jim Phelps told Reuters. The duo were walking in the desert after they evaded highway patrol officers on Saturday in a car chase and later crashed their stolen Volkswagen Jetta, he said. Once the couple was spotted from the air on Tuesday, officers on the ground moved in to make the arrest. Angela Marie Hill is seen in a police booking photo provided by the Sanpete County Sheriffs department in Manti, Utah, January 3, 2012. A couple wanted for a crime spree through Utah and Nevada that saw an elderly pair slain in their home and a woman shot in the head was arrested on Tuesday wandering in the desert, authorities said. Hill, 25, and Logan McFarland, 24, were spotted by the pilot of a sheriff's plane in a remote area of Elko County, in northern Nevada, Supervisory Deputy U.S. Marshal Jim Phelps told Reuters. REUTERS/U.S. Marshals Service/Handout“They gave up without incident because they were dehydrated and very tired,” Phelps said. “We positively identified them by their scars and tattoos, so we’re 100 percent confident that we have the suspects.” The U.S. Marshals Service said the couple began a crime spree on Thursday when they killed an elderly couple at their home in Mount Pleasant, Utah, 85 miles south of Salt Lake City. “We believe the motivation there was robbery,” Phelps said, adding that the couple stole a car and later drove to northern Nevada, where they tried to carjack a woman in West Wendover, Phelps said. The woman was shot in the head but managed to drive away, Phelps said. That victim has been treated at a hospital and was expected to survive, he said. The couple later managed to steal a Volkswagen Jetta in Wells, Nevada, on Saturday, where they also got into the car chase with highway patrol officers that led to their flight into the desert on foot, Phelps said. McFarland and Hill were being held on suspicion of kidnapping and attempted homicide in connection with the attempted carjacking in Nevada, and were expected to face additional charges as well, he said. **Reporting by Alex Dobuzinskis: Editing by Cynthia JohnstonOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.**\n",

    "- (Adds details) \\* New plant will have monthly production capacity of 100,000 wafers \\* Samsung has yet to decide investment size, venue \\* Flash market seen at \\$29 bln in 2012, China to take 50 pct SEOUL, Jan 4 (Reuters) - South Korea said on Wednesday it had approved a plan by Samsung Electronics Co to build a flash memory chip plant in China seen costing some \\$4 billion, as a boom in smartphones and tablet computers fuels the chip industry’s growth. The plant would be Samsung’s second overseas chip manufacturing site and reflects the growing importance of the Chinese market. China’s consumption of NAND-type flash memory chips is set to account for half the global flash market, estimated at \\$29 billion this year, and its portion will rise to 55 percent by 2015, according to research firm Gartner. The stellar growth is being driven by Chinese manufacturers such as Huawei Technologies and ZTE Corp  , which have been steadily raising their global smartphone and tablet market share. The new production line by Samsung will use cutting-edge 20-nanometer-class or below processing technology and mass production is planned to start from late 2013. Samsung has yet to decide on a site for the plant, which will have a capacity of 100,000 wafers per month. South Korea requires local firms to apply to build foreign production bases for fear of leakages of the country’s prized high technology. The Ministry of Knowledge and Economy said in a statement that Samsung would set up a committee to prevent potential technology leaks. Samsung is the world’s biggest NAND flash memory maker with around 40 percent of the market. It competes with Japan’s Toshiba Corp, Hynix Semiconductor Inc of Korea and Micron Technology Inc of the United States.\t \t  (Reporting by Miyoung Kim; Editing by Jonathan Hopfner)Our Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.  \n",
